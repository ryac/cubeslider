# CubeSlider

A jQuery plugin that transitions between elements using a 3D cube effect.

See a demo here: [http://www.ryac.ca/cubeslider][demo]

## Documentation

This effect was used on a project at [Invoke Media][invokemedia] and thought I'd make a pluginfo for it.

Download the [production version][min] or the [development version][max].

Refer to the [example page][example] to see how to structure your html and the js methods available to call.
